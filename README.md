**If a student doesn’t spend all of their of Dining Dollars(DD), UCSD forcibly withdraws the DD’s. The hoops a UCSD student goes through to avoid withdrawal:**
- Students are only allowed to sell DD in Spring Quarter
- Students lose their DD end of Fall Quarter of following year
- Students must independently find another student to sell to
- Students sell at a 2:1 ratio, losing 50% of their money

### Solution

**To appeal to both Buyers and Sellers of Dining Dollars we have to benefit both parties.**
1. Buyer goes on Triton2Go, decides what to order, makes order request on DDE
2. Seller accepts order and confirms price with Buyer
3. Buyer Pays 80% of actual price to Seller
4. Seller buys the Buyer’s Order with Dining Dollars
5. Done!

**Buyer gets 20% off  of any price on Triton2Go. Seller gets 80% back instead of 50%. Sellers and Buyers don’t need to be active on DDE and can exchange anytime during the year. Simple!**
